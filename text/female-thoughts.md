A collection of quotes from a Twitter account "Female Thoughts" (@realthoughtsfem). Supposedly, the thoughts from female minds. Could be AI generated. DGAF. Going to quote the quotes, and then provide my thoughts on the matter.

I'm aware that I shouldn't take these at face value and treat them like gospel. But I think most of these quotes, if not all of them, are "true", in that they provide wisdom.

I'm also not going to quote everything. Just because my time and energy are limited. I'm only going to quote things that help me learn "game".

Many of these don't really need explaining. Although most could still benefit from elaboration. I love how self-explanatory they are. A good look into the female mind.

# Posture

When he can't hold eye contact, I lose all interest.

I can't take a man serious who's constantly chattering.

# Dates, out in the field. How is she feeling when she first meets you and you're gaming her?

I don't want to discuss serious matters on a date.

Adventurous men are exciting, boring men are boring. It's as easy as that.

- Girls wanna have fun. They don't want to talk about serious things or be bored

He should pick up the cues that show if I like him.

Making eye contact and a light smile is the max I'll do to show interest.

- IOIs bro

If his friends are losers, is he a loser too?

- Status game. Also, preselection

If he hesitates, he can't be sure of himself.

Cowardice is the biggest turn off.

If he's afraid to walk up to me and talk... How is it gonna work out?

He is so confident of himself. There must be a reason for it. I have to admit that it makes me interested.

- Never let a girl manipulate you into changing yourself. Don't give her power over you

If I'm really interested, I'll let him know. If he's too engaged in me, it's a red flag.

- Girls aren't amoebas floating around, they have agency

I don't even particularly like him. But I respect him...

I respect if he's up-front. Even if I don't want to date him.

If I give a guy a chance, he should go for it in the moment. I'm not waiting until he finds some courage.

- Reading IOIs, realizing the entire world can be your dating app

# STR shiz. How is she feeling the first few times you're meeting her?

If there's no mystery about him, I'm not interested.

Sometimes I need him to be firm with me.

Better too firm than weak.

If he's not in control of his emotions, I don't feel safe showing mine.

If he is needy, I lose my respect.

If he can't be confidential, he's not a man to me.

I don't take him serious if he always argues with me.

It's okay if we fight sometimes. The worst thing is if nothing happens.

I can sense it if he's making up stuff.

I hate nothing more than when he ignores me.

It makes me uncomfortable if he makes me the center of things. He's responsible for direction.

- Sack: Date should be like you're having fun and she's along for the ride

Can't imagine anything worse than a boring man... Except a coward.

# LTR shiz. How is she feeling when she knows you quite well? Evaluating the relationship. Getting meta. How about when you're into her?

If I'm really into him, I'll show him. If not so much, I'll just tell him.

Every girl makes drama at times. He should be able to just ignore it and not blame her.

If he puts me above everything, it's like if he wants me to tell him what to do. And I want him, not me to be the leader.

He should find his purpose on his own. But I will support him when he's on it.

I want him to be obsessed with something. Doesn't matter what it is.

If there are no rules, does he even care about me?

I can't help myself but I lost respect when he started crying in front of me.

He should have other options but not act on them. I want to see that he is desired.

It was always drama with him. Such a stressful time. But never boring... pure intensity.

If he can't control himself, I'm not interested. I want someone to look up to.

# Meta

I'll bring him peace if he makes me feel secure.

If he wants the supportive me, he needs to be a provider first.

- Rivelino's original thread is bomb: https://twitter.com/alpharivelino/status/1656318368444497921

I want a man who built himself. Not one in the making.

Why is he using online dating apps? Can't he talk to women in real life?
