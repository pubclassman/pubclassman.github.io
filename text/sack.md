SACK!!!

# Dating app profile

Pictures:
- dog pics are a green flag - empathy
- you doing an activity - dynamic, some motion
- Show that you can do it all
- shirtless pics are bad

green flags
- animals in photos
- uniform of some sort. women love men in uniform
- banging career - do something where you just got off work (day in your life)
- in a suit (dress nice) (you can do it all) (you can take them to a nice place) (you know how to act in formal situations)

Look at your profile as if you knew nothing about you. And try and figure out what your profile says about you

sack's pictures portray:
- fun, confident
- doesn’t take himself too seriously

every photo should be some kind of a hook. that people will want to say something about. each photo will get someone different

no for photos:
guns, fish photos, no gambling photos, drugs

In general your filter for which photos you use should be very high

Sack's used only 3 photos sometimes

doesn’t like group photos in general. But if you do have it. It should be obvious which one you are and you should be in the center

# Convo tips

You can talk about anything as long as you make it interesting

“now u may be asking yourself”

pose some interesting questions and have them engage with you

you dont talk at them

when I talk. Sack feels like I’m talking from a textbook. Not talking with them. Talking at them

have fun and be interesting

just say what people wanna hear

sack puts a positive spin when he’s with people

but thats what people wanna hear

when he thinks of something negative, spin it in a positive way

its easy to get what you want when you say what people wanna hear

you can get your ego stroked if you fake being humble

# dating meta

dating is all about being humble but subtly flexing

they need to discover your greatness by themselves

you dont want to tell them how good you are, you want them to figure out how good you are

# life mottos

tackle life head on
never give up
know when to give up
- the best possible outcome is not worth the effort (everyone has limited time. cant be friends with everybody)

nothing in life is free
if its free to you, it costs someone else something

if its too good to be true, it probably is

if not now then when

it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. that is not weakness, that is life. there are many corpses on mount everest that were very dedicated people

the world doesnt wait for you to be ok

sometimes you just gotta pick yourself up and keep going

most of your problems are your fault

we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking that we used to create them

your words are very powerful

when you fail. you should beat yourself up once really bad. And then forgive yourself. And then have more compassion for myself

guilt is a terrible motivator

the opposite of edgy = apeshit crazy. you do what you wanna do and you don’t care about how other people view you. more energy. like when sack says “oh my god its pubclassman!!!”
- does it hurt anyone? is it morally or ethically wrong? no. then ill do what i wanna do

sack views all relationships as ephemeral and come and go. so he’ll just do whatever and whoever sticks around sticks around

have some compassion for yourself. you’re your own best friend. self-reliant

# misc

women like men who do stuff in the homicile - cooking, cleaning

not some alpha male

women love being respected

# my observations of sack

always down to spend time with you. Like he’ll always be enthusiastic about continuing the activity or the hangout

“this is true happiness right here”

dont you guys feel so fulfilled?

sack has good conversation continuation questions. Like often you can just repeat what they said as a question or just poke by adding a small twist

He puts positive spins on things - really enjoy the time with the boys, when are we ever gonna have a chance to hangout with the boys again like this, hes able to take his feel-good emotions and verbalize them whereas I would just be stewing in the emotions trying to figure out what to say

Whenever i feel something. I instantly start to think about it. And by the time I say it, it becomes a strategic statement instead of an emotion-backed reaction. And thats why its not engaging to talk to me

# thougts

When talking. U can agree along with them. Sounds of encouragement

Sack has these great dictation skills where he’ll say like “so hear me out” and then a nice pause and then go on his monologue

Real words come from emotions and the heart, not from thoughts

Try paying attention and converting your emotions into words in real time instead of ruminating and trying to come up with the perfect shit

If you have negative thoughts just put a positive spin on them and say it

# more great sack advice

Just have fun

Pose funny

Dont take yourself too seriously

Ddont be afraid to laugh at yourself in the moment

Stoip being so serious

Do things that are good for you and don’t do things that are bad for you

Just be yourself
