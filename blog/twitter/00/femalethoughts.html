            A collection of quotes from a Twitter account "Female Thoughts"
            (@realthoughtsfem). Supposedly, the thoughts from female minds. Could
            be AI generated. DGAF. Going to quote the quotes, and then provide my
            thoughts on the matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm aware that I shouldn't take these at face value and treat them
            like gospel. But I think most of these quotes, if not all of them, are
            "true", in that they provide wisdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also not going to quote everything. Just because my time and
            energy are limited. I'm only going to quote things that help me learn
            "game".
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of these don't really need explaining. Although most could still
            benefit from elaboration. I love how self-explanatory they are. A good
            look into the female mind.

            When he can't hold eye contact, I lose all interest.

          <p>
            I can't take a man serious who's constantly chattering.

            I don't want to discuss serious matters on a date.

            Adventurous men are exciting, boring men are boring. It's as easy as

          </ul>
          <p>
            He should pick up the cues that show if I like him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Making eye contact and a light smile is the max I'll do to show
            interest.

            If he hesitates, he can't be sure of himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cowardice is the biggest turn off.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he's afraid to walk up to me and talk... How is it gonna work out?
          </p>
          <p>
            He is so confident of himself. There must be a reason for it. I have
            to admit that it makes me interested.
          </p>

              Never let a girl manipulate you into changing yourself. Don't give
              her power over you
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If I'm really interested, I'll let him know. If he's too engaged in
            me, it's a red flag.
          </p>

            I don't even particularly like him. But I respect him...
          </p>
          <p>
            I respect if he's up-front. Even if I don't want to date him.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I give a guy a chance, he should go for it in the moment. I'm not
            waiting until he finds some courage.

            If there's no mystery about him, I'm not interested.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes I need him to be firm with me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Better too firm than weak.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he's not in control of his emotions, I don't feel safe showing
            mine.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he is needy, I lose my respect.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he can't be confidential, he's not a man to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't take him serious if he always argues with me.

          <p>
            It's okay if we fight sometimes. The worst thing is if nothing
            happens.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can sense it if he's making up stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hate nothing more than when he ignores me.
          </p>
          <p>
            It makes me uncomfortable if he makes me the center of things. He's
            responsible for direction.

          </ul>
          <p>
            Can't imagine anything worse than a boring man... Except a coward.

            the relationship. Getting meta. How about when you're into her?

          <p>
            If I'm really into him, I'll show him. If not so much, I'll just tell
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every girl makes drama at times. He should be able to just ignore it
            and not blame her.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he puts me above everything, it's like if he wants me to tell him
            what to do. And I want him, not me to be the leader.
          </p>
          <p>
            He should find his purpose on his own. But I will support him when
            he's on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want him to be obsessed with something. Doesn't matter what it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there are no rules, does he even care about me?
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't help myself but I lost respect when he started crying in front
            of me.
          </p>
          <p>
            He should have other options but not act on them. I want to see that
            he is desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was always drama with him. Such a stressful time. But never
            boring... pure intensity.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he can't control himself, I'm not interested. I want someone to
            look up to.

            I'll bring him peace if he makes me feel secure.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he wants the supportive me, he needs to be a provider first.

              Rivelino's original thread is bomb:

            I want a man who built himself. Not one in the making.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why is he using online dating apps? Can't he talk to women in real
            life?
