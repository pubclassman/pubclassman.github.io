        It's been a while since I first dove into this topic... 2018-2019, to
        be exact. Much has changed since then. Yet much, in other ways,
        remains similar.

        whole man-woman dynamic.

        One thing I'd like to say is, don't think you can skate by on logic
        and ideas alone. Experience (aka failure) and application are what
        actually make a difference.

        through the cracks in recent years.
