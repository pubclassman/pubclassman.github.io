      <ul>
        <li>
          dog pics are a green flag - empathy
        </li>
        <li>
          you doing an activity - dynamic, some motion
        </li>
        <li>
          Show that you can do it all
        </li>
        <li>
          shirtless pics are bad
        </li>
      </ul>

          animals in photos
        </li>
        <li>
          uniform of some sort. women love men in uniform
        </li>
        <li>
          banging career - do something where you just got off work (day in
          your life)
        </li>
        <li>
          in a suit (dress nice) (you can do it all) (you can take them to a
          nice place) (you know how to act in formal situations)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Look at your profile as if you knew nothing about you. And try and
        figure out what your profile says about you
      </p>
      <p>
        sack's pictures portray:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          fun, confident
        </li>
        <li>
          doesn’t take himself too seriously
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        every photo should be some kind of a hook. that people will want to
        say something about. each photo will get someone different
      </p>
      <p>
        no for photos:
      </p>
      <p>
        guns, fish photos, no gambling photos, drugs
      </p>
      <p>
        In general your filter for which photos you use should be very high
      </p>
      <p>
        Sack's used only 3 photos sometimes
      </p>
      <p>
        doesn’t like group photos in general. But if you do have it. It should
        be obvious which one you are and you should be in the center
      </p>

      <p>
        You can talk about anything as long as you make it interesting
      </p>
      <p>
        “now u may be asking yourself”
      </p>
      <p>
        pose some interesting questions and have them engage with you
      </p>
      <p>
        you dont talk at them
      </p>
      <p>
        when I talk. Sack feels like I’m talking from a textbook. Not talking
        with them. Talking at them
      </p>
      <p>
        have fun and be interesting
      </p>
      <p>
        just say what people wanna hear
      </p>
      <p>
        sack puts a positive spin when he’s with people
      </p>
      <p>
        but thats what people wanna hear
      </p>
      <p>
        when he thinks of something negative, spin it in a positive way
      </p>
      <p>
        its easy to get what you want when you say what people wanna hear
      </p>
      <p>
        you can get your ego stroked if you fake being humble
      </p>
      <h1>

      <p>
        dating is all about being humble but subtly flexing
      </p>
      <p>
        they need to discover your greatness by themselves
      </p>
      <p>
        you dont want to tell them how good you are, you want them to figure
        out how good you are
      </p>

      <p>
        tackle life head on
      </p>
      <p>
        never give up
      </p>
      <p>
        know when to give up
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the best possible outcome is not worth the effort (everyone has
          limited time. cant be friends with everybody)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        nothing in life is free
      </p>
      <p>
        if its free to you, it costs someone else something
      </p>
      <p>
        if its too good to be true, it probably is
      </p>
      <p>
        if not now then when
      </p>
      <p>
        it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. that is not
        weakness, that is life. there are many corpses on mount everest that
        were very dedicated people
      </p>
      <p>
        the world doesnt wait for you to be ok
      </p>
      <p>
        sometimes you just gotta pick yourself up and keep going
      </p>
      <p>
        most of your problems are your fault
      </p>
      <p>
        we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking that we used to
        create them
      </p>
      <p>
        your words are very powerful
      </p>
      <p>
        when you fail. you should beat yourself up once really bad. And then
        forgive yourself. And then have more compassion for myself
      </p>
      <p>
        guilt is a terrible motivator
      </p>
      <p>
        the opposite of edgy = apeshit crazy. you do what you wanna do and you
        don’t care about how other people view you. more energy. like when
        sack says “oh my god its pubclassman!!!”
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          does it hurt anyone? is it morally or ethically wrong? no. then ill
          do what i wanna do
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        sack views all relationships as ephemeral and come and go. so he’ll
        just do whatever and whoever sticks around sticks around
      </p>
      <p>
        have some compassion for yourself. you’re your own best friend.
        self-reliant
      </p>

        women like men who do stuff in the homicile - cooking, cleaning
      </p>
      <p>
        not some alpha male
      </p>
      <p>
        women love being respected
      </p>
      <h1>
        my observations of sack
      </h1>
      <p>
        always down to spend time with you. Like he’ll always be enthusiastic
        about continuing the activity or the hangout
      </p>
      <p>
        “this is true happiness right here”
      </p>
      <p>
        dont you guys feel so fulfilled?
      </p>
      <p>
        sack has good conversation continuation questions. Like often you can
        just repeat what they said as a question or just poke by adding a
        small twist
      </p>
      <p>
        He puts positive spins on things - really enjoy the time with the
        boys, when are we ever gonna have a chance to hangout with the boys
        again like this, hes able to take his feel-good emotions and verbalize
        them whereas I would just be stewing in the emotions trying to figure
        out what to say
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever i feel something. I instantly start to think about it. And by
        the time I say it, it becomes a strategic statement instead of an
        emotion-backed reaction. And thats why its not engaging to talk to me
      </p>
      <h1>
        thougts
      </h1>
      <p>
        When talking. U can agree along with them. Sounds of encouragement
      </p>
      <p>
        Sack has these great dictation skills where he’ll say like “so hear me
        out” and then a nice pause and then go on his monologue
      </p>
      <p>
        Real words come from emotions and the heart, not from thoughts
      </p>
      <p>
        Try paying attention and converting your emotions into words in real
        time instead of ruminating and trying to come up with the perfect shit
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have negative thoughts just put a positive spin on them and say
        it
      </p>
