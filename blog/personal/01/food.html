        <h1>
        Your life is simply an accumulation of choices you make in the present
        </h1>
        <p>
        For 5 years now, Iâ€™ve basically been binging everyday. Because I
        repeatedly made the same choice of instant gratification and
        postponing my health to the future.
        </p>
        <p>
        And I will continue to be faced with that same choice every single day
        </p>
        <p>
        And as long as you fail to do something different. And make a
        different choice when faced with the same situation. You'll remain the
        same person
        </p>
        <h1>
        The only thing you can change is the present moment
        </h1>
        <p>
        Change is hard
        </p>
        <p>
        It requires overcoming your emotions
        </p>
        <p>
        But change can only be made in the present. Never in the future.
        Because the present is the only thing that exists
        </p>
        <p>
        When you're ready to change. You can then start making the new
        decision in the same situation
        </p>
        <p>
        Remember the present is the only thing that exists. You choose who you
        want to be
        </p>
        <h1>
        Lack of self-control is a self-fulfilling illusion
        </h1>
        <p>
        Everything you do is a conscious choice
        </p>
        <p>
        The idea that you don't have control is so so so stupid. It's like
        saying you can't choose whether or not to punch that wall out of
        frustration. You can't choose to move your right hand up to flip that
        light switch.
        </p>
        <p>
        Obviously it's not binary. Obviously it's more nuanced than that:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Yes we have habits aka neural pathways that have become efficient
        </li>
        <li>
            Yes we have emotions and impulses which do influence us
        </li>
        <li>
            Yes we have certain physical limitations (like if we don't eat we'll
            starve)
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        But fundamentally, everything you do is a conscious choice
        </p>
        <h1>
        Mental "desire" (fantasy) =/= actually wanting to change yourself
        </h1>
        <p>
        I enjoy mentally fantasizing about being skinny and lean and healthy.
        But that's all it is. Mental fantasizing
        </p>
        <p>
        When I actually get in that spot. The tradeoff is quite different. If
        you don't make the choice. Then you don't change. And you DIDN'T WANT
        TO CHANGE. Because if you wanted to change. You would have changed. By
        making the different choice
        </p>
        <p>
        Every one thinks they want to be skinny. But they actually want to be
        skinny at no cost
        </p>
        <p>
        The people who ACTUALLY want to do things. Are the people who actually
        go grind. Who progress. And the rest. Are the people who want it at no
        cost. Who just want to fantasize about it. They don't want it enough
        </p>
        <h1>
        Purpose
        </h1>
        <p>
        The way to overcome an addiction. Is to have a purpose. That means
        more to you than whatever that addiction provides in this moment
